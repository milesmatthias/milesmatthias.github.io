<p>The only website I&#8217;ve seen do this is m.funnyordie.com and it&#8217;s pretty interesting. As we are seeing more and more mobile web apps look like native apps, this is the only one I&#8217;ve seen that looks truly like a standalone native app. I&#8217;m curious to find out how it works.Â </p>
