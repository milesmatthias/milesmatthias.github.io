<p>I want to be able to give feedback anywhere, anytime. And I don&#8217;t want any website to have to sign up with a company.</p>

<p>One company should allow you to make marks anywhere, anytime, submit your feedback to that company, and then that company should do whatever method of feedback the site you&#8217;re trying to give feedback to takes.</p>

<p>For instance - imagine the user using the same software to edit Wikipedia, give feedback on design changes for Google, and submit help to github?</p>

<p>That would be cool.</p>
