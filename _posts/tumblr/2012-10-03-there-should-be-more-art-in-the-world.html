<p>Art isn&#8217;t about high-end, fancy crap that everyone thinks about. Art is about sharing a story - sharing who you are, where you&#8217;ve been, and what lessons you&#8217;ve learned. Everything should have art - everything should tell a story and express emotions.</p>

<p>Anthony Bourdain is a great example of showing what that means outside of paint and plaster. Food is a great medium for people to express who they are, what they care about, and where they want to go. Those are the restaurants and meals that he talks about and enjoys the most. The ones where the chef takes everything they are and encapsulates that in their end product of food. As an eater, you can taste the emotions, history, and aspirations of a person. That is the purpose of every art medium - express emotion to your user.</p>

<p>Tech should have more art. Apple is a great example. Not because they&#8217;re fancy or expensive, but because when you use one of their products, you can feel who the people at Apple are and what they care about. If I had to invent a tagline for Apple to describe their goals, it would be, &#8220;Life is awesome. You should live it as best you can.&#8221; Their products help you do those mundane things in the most efficient way possible and gets out of your way so you can enjoy your life. Connect with your loved ones when you&#8217;re traveling and sharing pictures with those you love.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what I want to do in every company I start - tell a story and transfer emotions.</p>
