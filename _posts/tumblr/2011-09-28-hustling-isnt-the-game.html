<p class="p1">I&#8217;ve never been a good runner. Even though I&#8217;ve usually been overweight and out of shape, I&#8217;ve always been able to beat anyone in a sprint. Running a mile though? I could barely <em>walk</em> a mile. Whenever I would have to do the mile in gym class I would dread it. You would think I was about to try to climb Everest with how white my face got. With every ounce of me completely against running a mile, I did finish it. But I always did it the wrong way - I always sprinted the mile.</p>

<p class="p1">Recently I&#8217;ve taken up running again and I haven&#8217;t sprinted once. I bought a heart rate monitor, allowed it to tell me what was too much for me to take on, and just kept going. Unassumingly, I will just start walking. Then I&#8217;ll run because I want to. My heart rate monitor will tell me to slow down because my heart is on the verge of exploding. So I go back to walking. Then after a while I run again. I used to feel like I was about to die every time I did any sort of distance running, but now I get that elusive &#8220;runner&#8217;s high&#8221; each and every time I run. I know my limits, listen to myself, and most importantly - I run because it&#8217;s fun. I&#8217;m hoping to do my first marathon in the next year.</p>

<p class="p1">Why does this matter? Because it applies to everything else in my life. Everything I&#8217;ve struggled with - my weight, my health, my career, and my relationships - have all gained from approaching life with the running, not sprinting, mentality. I wanted to write this post to help anyone out there that might be like me - watching the YC and TechStars teams get 3 hours or less of sleep at night, use t-shirts for towels, and bathe once a month because they&#8217;re working on their startup 20 hours a day. Don&#8217;t feel hopeless. Don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re not earning it. Don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re not working hard enough. You know what happens - you go strong for about a week and then you crash hard. </p>

<p class="p1">I did. This week for me has been the first week back after crashing for about a month. I was working late nights and weekends on my goals, and I got to a point where I was too sick of a computer to even look at one. I considered changing my profession entirely. But through the help of my wonderful fiancee, I recognized that it was normal for me to feel that way. Just like my running, when I got back to working hard, I was going harder than any other time in my life. And I know I&#8217;ll crash again, but it won&#8217;t be so soon this time. And I won&#8217;t be out of the game for so long. Each crash cycle will get shorter, each running cycle will get longer and faster - and I&#8217;ll get where I&#8217;m going.</p>

<p class="p1">My fiancee has a random quote generator on her Android and she sends me quotes often. She&#8217;s been sending me this one repeatedly recently to keep me going. It&#8217;s amazing what what forget when we get older:</p>
