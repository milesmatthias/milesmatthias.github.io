This week Facebook made some news. I’m not talking about the ridiculous IPO, I’m talking about the ridiculous iPhone app “Camera”. I didn’t buy any Facebook stock because I can’t stand their company and how they do things. “Camera” is a fine example of their sleaziness.

First off, they just paid $1 billion for Instagram and instead of putting effort into evolving Instagram itself into what they want it to be, they release a knock-off version of Instagram solely for Facebook. Why would they do that? Well, maybe they didn’t want to be accused of copyright infringement. Doubtful. They probably did it to have the smart people at Instagram help them design and write “Camera” and even let them borrow parts of their code. Fine, but you have enough smart engineers at Facebook, and they could have done it all by themselves. Surely the acquisition of Facebook is part of a larger, long term strategy, but releasing a crappy version of Instagram right after paying a billion dollars to own Instagram seems like a really dumb thing to do.

That’s not what this post is even really about; I just needed to get that out. What really bothers me about the Camera app is that Facebook will sink to trickery to snatch people’s pictures for Facebook’s revenue streams. For those of you without an iPhone, there is already an app called “Camera” on the iPhone. It’s written by Apple and is included with every iOS, camera enabled device. It does exactly what it says - gives users the ability to take pictures and video. That’s it.

Facebook decided to name their app “Camera” in the hopes that some users would confuse the two and instead of using Apple’s Camera app, they would use Facebook’s version. They hope that users will unexpectedly take pictures with Facebook’s Camera app and instead of just saving the picture locally to the user’s device or on the cloud with Apple iCloud for storing and sharing later, the picture will automatically get uploaded to Facebook so they can have better usage statistics, so they can please their newly appointed wall street bosses.

They took it a step further to design an icon that looks exactly like the built-in Apple Camera app.



Can’t you see your parents or grandparents mistaking this app for the Apple Camera app and never noticing? (Unaffiliated picture by Matt Galligan)

This is why I hate Facebook as a company: Facebook doesn’t care about their users. Facebook only cares about their revenue stream. They will violate your privacy, they will deceive you, they will give you the worst website and mobile app service imaginable, because they don’t care about you. They generate money from selling advertising space and stocks. That’s who their customers are and that’s who they please.

And yet, people still use it every day. I still use it. The only reason I use it is because all of my family is on it and even with Facebook’s terrible app experience, it’s much easier to share a picture on Facebook to show everyone in my family than e-mailing everyone individually. Facebook knows this, and that’s why they don’t care.

I also have no idea why Apple would allow this. It’s so blatant and dirty, and yet with Apple’s extensive App Store restrictions, this got through. That’s a separate post for some day I guess.
