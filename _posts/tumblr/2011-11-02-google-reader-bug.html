<p>Google Reader released an updated UI today and I thought I would try it out again. I haven&#8217;t used Reader in a few years, but as I follow more people&#8217;s blogs online, I could use it (And I like the <a href="http://reederapp.com" target="_blank">Reeder</a> apps for iPhone).</p>
<p>But alas, similar to their <a href="https://plus.google.com/100940716892313727285/posts/4aPVQTj9jyL" target="_blank">release of the Gmail iPhone app today</a>, it&#8217;s buggy. My main beef bug that I found? <strong>Google Reader doesn&#8217;t actually delete folders.</strong>Â </p>
<p>Try it - make a folder, delete it, and then try to make a new folder with the exact same name. Google Reader will say that the changes have been saved, but nothing actually changes.</p>
<p>More evidence: open Reeder, or any other Google Reader client, and see that the folders you &#8220;deleted&#8221; still show up.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the deal Google? Anyone else had any issues with it?</p>
