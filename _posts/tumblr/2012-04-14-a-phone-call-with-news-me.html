<p>Like a lot of other people, I heard about <a href="http://www.news.me" target="_blank">News.me</a> through my friends sharing articles on Twitter and began experimenting with it. After using the app for a while, I was contacted by one of the editors at News.me looking to see if I would have a few minutes to chat about how I use their app and give any feedback. He noticed I was making a few reactions in their app, and wanted to know my thoughts in more detail. I love helping startups, so I didn&#8217;t mind at all to take a few minutes out of my day.</p>

<p>The conversation was great and I think they got some good feedback on how I use their app and how to improve it. One of the things we talked about was how to increase the amount of reactions. I cautioned them against making a big deal of adding friends or getting followers because it would make them seem more like another social network, instead of the news service that it is. Instead they thought of being able to invite friends to discuss individual articles on News.me. I thought this was a great idea since I naturally discuss articles I&#8217;ve read with my friends.</p>

<p>They introduced me to a few features that I didn&#8217;t know about as well, including my new favorite - daily e-mail summary. It&#8217;s my morning newspaper of articles that my friends shared and talked about yesterday, just in case I didn&#8217;t catch them. It&#8217;s also short - rounded down to 4 or 5 articles so I&#8217;m not overwhelmed every morning.</p>

<p>We also talked about their reading list. At first, I got excited that the News.me app interacted with the Safari reading list on my iPhone, but then I remembered that Apple hasn&#8217;t released developer support to access the reading list yet. I immediately discarded ever using the reading list within News.me since it was localized to one app on my iPhone, instead of on multiple devices that I read on. I reconsidered when they told me that there are more tools to take advantage of the News.me reading list, like the bookmark for all modern browsers that I can use on my desktop. This has sparked my interest and I&#8217;m anticipating using their reading list more than the Safari reading list now. I mainly used the Safari reading list because of using news:yc to read Hacker News on my iPhone.</p>

<p>Two notes about their reading list though:</p>

<p>1) <strong>I don&#8217;t like bookmarklets.</strong></p>

<p>I know they&#8217;re really nice for young companies without much time because it&#8217;s fast and you&#8217;re able to code once and deploy to any modern browser, but I don&#8217;t readily have my bookmarks bar open in Chrome as it&#8217;s almost always hidden. Plus, I want more interactivity. I want to be able to scroll through my reading list on my desktop, delete articles, re-share articles, react to articles, etc. I want all of the Safari reading list functionality plus the News.me sharing and conversation benefits all within a browser extension. I know they&#8217;re a young company so they need to spend their resources wisely, but I&#8217;m hoping that eventually they&#8217;ll have more resources to do browser specific extensions and have more functionality in the desktop browser itself.</p>

<p>2) <strong>How do I add an article I&#8217;m reading on Mobile Safari to the News.me reading list?</strong></p>

<p>I could try the bookmarklet route but I&#8217;m not sure if that will even work, let alone being awkward to use. Even though my reading of Hacker News has declined (as has that community some would argue), I still find a few articles a month interesting enough to open them in Safari on my iPhone and add it to my reading list. If I could add those articles to News.me instead and then invite my friends to discuss the articles with me, I&#8217;d use it a lot more.</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p>I really like News.me and I&#8217;m happy that they reached out to me to discuss it further. I love that News.me&#8217;s aim is not to create another social network, but to make a new type of news network. A news network that is determined by me. My news shouldn&#8217;t be determined by huge corporations that decide what to put on tv or their websites based on what will make them the most money. My news is my news, so it should be dominated by my interests, my motivations, and my confidants.</p>

<p>I also love that News.me knows that just reading news isn&#8217;t the whole picture. Sure, reading interesting articles is fun and keeps me up-to-date and learning, but I&#8217;d say over half of the usefulness of reading articles online comes from discussing them with people. I put my new knowledge to use, bouncing ideas and implications of articles off my friends who are just as techie, and ending up with more understanding, knowledge, and perspective than if I would have just read the article by myself.</p>

<p>Also, the News.me&#8217;s article parsing is super, super fast on my iPhone 4. Love it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m really happy that I was given the opportunity to speak on the phone with some of the people at News.me. Like I said, I love helping startups, and if I can offer my technical experience and feedback to any of them, I&#8217;ll happily do it. I hope they take my feedback, along with lots of other feedback they get, and run fast! Good luck guys!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to chat for a few minutes about your startup and get my developer and user feedback, <a href="mailto:miles.matthias@gmail.com" target="_blank">shoot me an e-mail</a>.</p>
