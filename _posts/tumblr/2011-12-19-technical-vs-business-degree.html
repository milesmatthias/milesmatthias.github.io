<p>I overheard some people discussing best path for someone to open their own business. They felt that it was more important to get a business degree, and then learn technical skills later. I wasn&#8217;t surprised - these were business people talking.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m more of a technical person, so I say that getting a technical degree initially is far more important than a business degree. Business principles are simple compared to the intricacies of building something. It&#8217;s also much more central to the end goal of owning a business to be able to actually create value by being able to build a product. You can learn all of the marketing and financial tactics you want, but if you can&#8217;t provide a product or service to your customers, none of it matters.</p>
<p>Tech people rule. Am I just biased? Do you agree?</p>
