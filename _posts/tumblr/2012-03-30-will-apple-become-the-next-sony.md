Sony is on a slump, seeing their revenue streams drop and a failed CEO stepping out. As I watched the morning show on CNBC today, they debated whether or not Apple would become the next Sony.

My answer - no. Well, maybe……. no. Definitely. Probably. If Steve Jobs were immortal, then I would say definitely, absolutely, no. Unfortunately, people are people and they come and go. Fortunately, Steve ingrained his passion for innovation, focus, and standards of quality into his entire company in order to continue Steve’s success. They will continue to focus on a handful of products, continue to push the envelope in every way regardless of stock prices or revenue projections, and they will continue to aim beyond their highest expectations for their products. They will continue to make the user their priority and focus. I think that Steve pushed these mantras enough on his company and they believed them too, so no, I don’t think Apple will become the next Sony.

I see two possible ways for Apple’s demise:

1) _Several generations of Apple employees and leadership pass and they forget all of the values that made Steve and Apple so successful. _

2) They lose their ‘wow’ factor with consumers when releasing and advertising products and that turns into a loss of confidence in the quality of their products. What I mean is, when consumers see advertisements for new Apple products or see Apple’s live presentations of new products and hear actual Apple employees or commercials give claims of “We just blew a hole in the universe!” or “It’s so so so incredible and I can’t believe it!!” or “It’s just sooooo amazing!”, they roll their eyes. We expect great things for Apple. So to hear them toot their own horn - well, it’s getting boring. The good thing is that Apple recognizes this.

They know that the effectiveness of their live rockstar like announcements is starting to dwindle so they’ve been adjusting. Remember the announcement of the new Mac OS X Mountain Lion a while back? They normally would have done the whole show - a huge stage with all of the features on display and lots of impassioned speeches. Instead, they saved that live excitement for the release of the new iPad. In order to get the world out about their new product, they travelled around the country and went one-by-one to the top tech blog writers and product reviewers to give them the same live show. And it worked. They generated lots of buzz and got lots of coverage. The final results will come this summer when Mountain Lion is released and we see the true effect of this new announcement strategy.

So do I think Apple will become the next Sony? Nope. Definitely. Maybe. No, no, no.
