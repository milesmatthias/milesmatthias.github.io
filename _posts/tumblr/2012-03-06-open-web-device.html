<p>Last week, Telefonica and Mozilla announced a partnership to develop the <a href="http://www.openwebdevice.com/" target="_blank">Open Web Device</a>, a cell phone with an operating system based solely on open web standards (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS). I immediately got excited about this partnership and we had a nice discussion at my office about it. My coworkers were quickly to point out that HP tried something similar in webOS and ask questions about how iOS and Android could foster this.</p>

<p>The main questions were:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you think this will get traction when Palm/HP couldn&#8217;t with their HTML5 OS and apps?
  What do you think is lacking in iOS and Android for HTML5 support?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I never took the time to learn more about webOS because from a consumer&#8217;s point of view, my generation grew up with these old clunky huge boxes that had HP on them and we all kicked because Doom froze. I don&#8217;t see HP (currently) as an inspired company that cares about making a good product that they believe in. Meg Whitman only cares about impatiently generating profits and being known as the whip cracker in silicon valley, which is why she pulled webOS within months of being named CEO and not really giving it the chance that it deserved.</p>
  
  <p>Still from the consumer&#8217;s point of view, this is made by a cool, new group I&#8217;ve never heard of before (even though I do know that Telefonica was founded in 1924), backed by the exact organization they need to be partnered with (Mozilla), and it&#8217;s apparent from being on their website for three seconds that they&#8217;re going to dedicate themselves to this through hell and high water because they believe in it. So I believe in it too.</p>
  
  <p>As far as iOS and Android, they need to help HTML5 developers by providing more comprehensive and faster Javascript API access to native features. Then they need to help everyone by allowing web apps to be indistinguishable from a native app in their app stores. Consumers understand the concept of an app and know where to get them - the app store - and changing that mindset to get them to use &#8220;Add to Home Screen&#8221; from Safari (or the Android equivalent) just isn&#8217;t going to happen. PhoneGap as a wrapper is an okay patch in the meantime, but not a long term solution without the assistance of Apple and Google.</p>
