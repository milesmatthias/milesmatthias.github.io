<p>At the viewing for my grandpa on Tuesday night we had an opportunity to stand up and share a memory of him with the family. I was enjoying listening to everyone else&#8217;s stories so I didn&#8217;t think of any at the time, but I remembered one that I wish I would have remembered earlier:</p>

<p>One year for Thanksgiving we had our family dinner in the basement of a church in a town about an hour away from my grandparent&#8217;s home in Cedar Falls. I don&#8217;t remember how old I was. Mom let me ride with grandpa, so I climbed in the passenger seat, just me and grandpa in the car.</p>

<p>We got on the highway and he said, &#8220;Hey Miles, want to play a game?&#8221; I&#8217;m pretty competitive so I said, &#8220;Sure, you&#8217;re going down Grandpa!&#8221;</p>

<p>He continues to explain the game to me, &#8220;Okay, we each look out our own windows and count how many horses we see on our side. When we get to the church, whoever has the most horses wins.&#8221; This was going to a landslide: a young kid versus a senior citizen focusing on driving. I had this in the bag.</p>

<p>"Two rules though: if there is a cemetery on your side, your count gets reset to 0." Okay, that makes sense. "And, you automatically win if there&#8217;s a 2 ton, steel bull on your side." I didn&#8217;t know Iowa that well at the time, so naturally I said to him, "Are you sure that&#8217;s tobacco in your pipe grandpa? Maybe I should be driving."</p>

<p>I sit straight up and get ready to count. A few minutes later I say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got 12! How many do you have Grandpa?&#8221; He sadly replies, &#8220;2.&#8221; I wonder if I should omit a few horses from my count to not make this so one sided, but after all I&#8217;m his grandkid so that thought went right out my head. I even see some ostriches and convince grandpa to let me count ostriches too. I was so excited.</p>

<p>4 cemeteries on my side. 4. I was so mad. Every time a cemetery would pass though, there was usually a ranch with a few horses on the other side so I tried to count as many as I could thinking that I was still in the running.</p>

<p>About 45 minutes into the trip, I&#8217;m plastered to my window looking for every horse I could find, and grandpa taps me on the shoulder and says, &#8220;Hey Miles, look what&#8217;s coming up on my side.&#8221;</p>

<p>A 2 ton, steel bull.</p>

<p>As mad as I was about the cemeteries, I was livid and astounded about this. I realized that grandpa grew up in Iowa and probably knew these highways like the back of his hand. &#8220;You set me up Grandpa! Not fair!&#8221;</p>

<p>The entire Thanksgiving dinner all I could think about was riding home with grandpa so I could have the bull on my side and rub it in his face.</p>

<p>I begged my mom to let me ride back to Cedar Falls with him, got in the car with him all excited, and immediately asked, &#8220;Hey can we play the horse counting game again?!&#8221;</p>

<p>His reply: &#8220;Nah, that game is no fun anymore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Out of all of the games I played with my grandpa over the year, this one sticks with me and I still hold a bit of a grudge. You were a clever guy and I&#8217;ll miss you, Grandpa.</p>
