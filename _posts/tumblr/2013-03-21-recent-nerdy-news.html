<p>Lots of cool stuff has been happening and if you&#8217;ve been too busy or you&#8217;ve been living under a rock, I&#8217;ll provide a little summary of the things I think have been the coolest:</p>

<ul><li><p><a href="http://www.bezosexpeditions.com/updates.html" target="_blank">Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO, lifts the Apollo F-1 engines off of the ocean floor</a> When man first travelled to the moon, NASA&#8217;s engineers had no way of retrieving the engines that shot its astronauts out of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere and then fell back to Earth and landed in the ocean. So for almost 60 years, a key component of the mission to the moon that inspired a generation has been sitting on the ocean&#8217;s floor. Jeff Bezos, the Founder and CEO of Amazon, was one of those kids motivated by the Apollo missions, and made it his mission to get those engines back. This week, he did it! Follow the link for pictures!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://playground.webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow launches a preview of their responsive design layout tool</a> For a while now responsive design has been a big buzz word and a goal for a lot of designers and developers - code once and any device size can interact and see your website perfectly. This work has mainly been done by hand up until Webflow came along. They&#8217;re a startup that has the goal of allowing anyone to design a responsive website visually, and get all of the HTML and CSS to host their responsive website anywhere. It&#8217;s pretty cool!</p></li>
