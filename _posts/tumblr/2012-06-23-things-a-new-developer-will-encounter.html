<p>When you get hired as a software developer, there are technologies that will be part of your daily work that aren&#8217;t in the job description. For example, you might be hired as a Javascript developer, but how are you going to share your code with your teammates? How are you going to get your work to the development or production servers?</p>

<p>These are very simple technologies that are a breeze to pick up, but if you&#8217;re nervous about that first day and want to do everything you can to make sure things go well, here are some topics to look into that you might encounter in working as a developer:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell" target="_blank">SSH</a> (key-based and password based)</li>
<li><a href="http://learn.github.com/p/intro.html" target="_blank">git</a></li>
<li><a href="http://milesmatthias.com/2012/06/01/unix-aliases-are-pretty-handy.html" target="_blank">unix aliases</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)" target="_blank">/etc/hosts</a> definitions</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_folding" target="_blank">code folding</a> (if you&#8217;re joining a big existing project)</li>
</ul><p>What technologies do you have to add? Add them in the comments below!</p>
