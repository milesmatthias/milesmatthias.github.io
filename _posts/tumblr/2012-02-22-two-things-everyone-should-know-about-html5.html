<h6>1) HTML5 is a movement to bring the power, speed, and overall feel of desktop applications to the web.</h6>

<p></p>

<p>Up until a few years ago, the web was used mainly for getting and sending information between computers. To put it more technically, it was for sending and recieving raw data. If you actually wanted to do anything with that data, you would need to have a desktop program that could manipulate that data to do what you wanted. Then you could send your finished project back out on the web.</p>



<p>For example, say I wanted to visualize financial stock prices over a certain time and try to notice some trends. I would use my networked computer to ask another computer out on the internet to give me stock prices for the last five years. A computer would respond with the raw data - stock tickers, numbers for the prices, and dates.</p>



<p>Then with that data saved to my computer, I would open a desktop program that could read that data. If I didn’t have a program that could read that data, I would have to download one. I would ask that program to show me a graph of the prices for a particular graph over time. The program would read the data, generate images based on the data, and then display a pretty image for me on my screen. Then I could use the program to save that image to my hard drive. If I wanted to share it with the rest of the world, I would send the image I created out on the internet.</p>



<p>With HTML5, we’re tired of having to download a program to a computer in order do things. We’re tired of being forced to have a certain type of computer in order to have the programs that we want. Want iMovie but don’t have a Mac? You’re screwed! Want Microsoft Excel but don’t have a PC? Jump off a cliff!</p>



<p>Every computer has a browser, and we want to take advantage of that fact. Browsers are getting so much faster and powerful that we can now do very similar things in our web browser that we once had to do on a desktop program. Want to edit a spreadsheet of stock data? Check out <a href="http://docs.google.com" target="_blank">Google Docs</a>, where you can create, edit, and share documents all in your browser, regardless of computer type or desktop programs.</p>



<h6>2) HTML5 tries to create a seamless experience for any device.</h6>

<p></p>

<p>Ever downloaded an app on your iPhone and loved it so much that you decided to tell your friend about it, only to discover that since your friend has an Android, the app you love on the iPhone is either non-existant or completely different on his/her Android phone? That sucks.</p>



<p>HTML5 says, I don’t care what device you have. I love you dear user, and I want you to be able to use my web app, regardless of what device you’re on. With more and more devices becoming smarter and more engaging (Look - <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/topic/apps-on-your-fridge" target="_blank">refrigerators</a> and <a href="http://www.toyota.com/entune/" target="_blank">cars</a> with apps!), it’s crucial to users that they get a seamless experience between all of their devices and to developers making the apps that they don’t need to build an app for each and every device they want to support. If developers really needed to build an app for each and every device, they would spend their entire careers chasing down the subtle differences between devices and rushing to support new devices instead of spending their time making cool new features for their users.</p>



<p>Instead of downloading different apps for each device from different app stores, an app can live on one computer on the internet, and any device at all that wants to see that app can simply tell that computer they want the app. They do that with their browser. Remember <a href="http://docs.google.com" target="_blank">Google Docs</a>? When you visit the Google Docs website with your browser, your computer is talking to Google’s computers, letting it know that it wants the Google Docs app. Google’s computers respond, saying, here you go. Your browser says thanks, and then runs the app for you to use.</p>



<p>With HTML5, developers can build one single app, host it online, and any device can use it. The developers don’t need to waste time worrying about how to support one specific device or brand over another (iOS vs Android? I don’t care. Toyota vs Chevy? Don’t care. Samsung or Frigidaire? Don’t care.). Go ahead, try it out with <a href="http://docs.google.com" target="_blank">Google Docs</a> or even <a href="http://www.starbucks.com" target="_blank">Starbucks</a>. View it on your desktop, then check it out on a smartphone, and then a tablet. If you’re so lucky to already have a fridge or car with apps already, get off the couch and check it out there too. You’ll get the same experience, with the same features, everywhere, every device, every time.</p>
