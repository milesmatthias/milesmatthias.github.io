<p>I saw my friend Chris Eidhof do an app in four weeks, and I thought it would be a great thing for me to do since I&#8217;m learning Sencha Touch these next few weeks. I&#8217;ve never done much with Sencha Touch and I&#8217;ll be using it in my next job.</p>

<p>I think that my previous app idea of a place to track contacts to keep in touch with on a rotation is simple enough to do in three weeks.</p>

<p>Basically, one screen with a list of the contacts you&#8217;ve entered to be on rotation. When you mark one as contacted/checked-up with, it moves that person to the bottom of the list. I think it makes most sense to let all of the names in the list be &#8216;checkable&#8217;, because who knows when you bump into people.</p>

<p>There would be another screen for adding a name to the list. I think that&#8217;s where I could get fancy. I would start by simply adding names. Then I might add support for adding a phone number, with the added feature of calling the person when you tap their name. Eventually, I could add the ability to add a name from your address book, or create a new contact in the address book from the name and number you put in.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll start with the very basic functionality and add features as I learn more about Sencha Touch and I have time.</p>

<p>This week I&#8217;m going to do some introductory learning about Sencha Touch, some basic prototypes, and some searches on the app store to see if there is anything similar out there.</p>

<p>Feel free to leave me feedback!</p>
