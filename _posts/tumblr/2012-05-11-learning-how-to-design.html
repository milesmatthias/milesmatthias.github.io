<a href="http://www.trydesignlab.com/">Learning how to design.</a><br/><p>I&#8217;ve been trying to learn design more and more lately so that I can be a more well-rounded programmer, however it&#8217;s been a struggle. I&#8217;ve been reading books, including <a href="http://designforhackers.com/" target="_blank">Design For Hackers</a> but haven&#8217;t been able to turn things I read into actual projects where I use that design knowledge.</p>

<p>This service is free, and takes an approach that makes me hopeful for learning some design practices. Each week they issue a challenge to teach you and help you grow in a certain design aspect. You submit your work and your work is given review and feedback by the entire community of other design students and a group of design experts.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m excited about this. I&#8217;ll blog about how it&#8217;s going.</p>
