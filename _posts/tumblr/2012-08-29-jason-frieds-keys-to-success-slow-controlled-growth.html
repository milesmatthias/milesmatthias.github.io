I really believe he has the right attitude towards running a company. The happiness of people is the most important thing in the world, and your business tactics should reflect that. That means doing things for the long term and doing what&#8217;s right to make customers and employees happy. The story of 37Signals encourages me to constantly ask, &#8220;What&#8217;s important here?&#8221; when making decisions, instead of assuming what everyone else is doing reflects what&#8217;s important.</p>
