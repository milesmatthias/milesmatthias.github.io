<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/orchestra-to-do/id459356540?mt=8" target="_blank">Orchestra</a> for the past few weeks and thought I&#8217;d take a second to write about my experience and share my suggestions. Hopefully it helps the great crew at Orchestra make it better.</p>
<p>Orchestra is a pretty simple to-do app, with one exception. You make lists, then tasks on those lists, but their claim to fame - you share those tasks with people, regardless of whether or not they&#8217;re a user of Orchestra. </p>
<p>If you share a task with someone that isn&#8217;t a user of Orchestra, they get a text or email letting them know and giving them a chance to say something about the task. Something about the task? What?</p>
<p>This is my favorite part of Orchestra. Each task is like a conversation thread. You can invite people to join you in discussing the task or just talk away yourself. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using each task as an endless bin of thoughts where I can keep everything semi-organized. I used to use notes, but really I need notes with a bin for my thoughts. Everything revolves around getting something done - which is why I love the tasks - but nothing is definite of quick - so I need a place to keep all of my thoughts as they progress when trying to accomplish the task. </p>
<p>For instance - I know that with my work as a developer and my pursuit to own my own business, I experience a lot of random things that would benefit myself to keep track of and others to learn from. But I&#8217;m horrible at remembering stuff.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I have a list called &#8216;blog ideas&#8217; where I make a task anytime I think of something I should write about and share. Then if I have more random thoughts or specific details that I want to remember, I just throw it under the task as a comment. Everything is organized, I don&#8217;t have to worry about keeping it organized, and Orchestra lets me throw all my random thoughts at it. I&#8217;m canceling my Evernote subscription.</p>
<p>The other thing that has proved invaluable to me in using this app is its corresponding web app. I can throw all my random thoughts on my phone where ever I am and when it comes time to sit down and write a blog post, all of my thoughts are on the web app. (Also, if you&#8217;re pretty nerdy and want a great example of an HTML5 web app that works just as well offline as online - you should see orchestra.com.) In fact, this blog post itself is compromised of my random scribbles that I&#8217;ve thrown into the Orchestra app on my phone about doing a review of Orchestra!</p>
<p>The iOS app itself is also a great demonstration of how cool customizing iOS components can be. I questioned whether or not it was written in native Obj-C or HTML5, but when I tweeted it I was very nicely responded by one of Orchestra&#8217;s iOS engineers:</p>

<p>This wasn&#8217;t too surprising considering that when I couldn&#8217;t figure out why I couldn&#8217;t share an entire list with my fiancee, Orchestra&#8217;s customer support team was more than willing to lend me an explanation:</p>

<blockquote>Hi Miles, My sincerest apologies for the delay in getting back to you! We&#8217;ve been looking into this and believe we found the root of the problem - let me explain:Basically we only send text messages when tasks are shared with a phone number, not shared lists - only because there&#8217;s not a great way to make the latter actionable on the phone for a non-user. This is not a great experience, so we&#8217;ll be changing it soon so shared list invites do go over text message. So stay tuned for that. In the meantime if you send a share a task with her phone number, that will initiate a text message. Better yet, if she gets an <span class="il">Orchestra</span> account and adds her phone number to Settings &lt; Profile, those tasks and list invitations will arrive in her app. Apologies for this confusion and shortcoming on our part, thanks for bringing it to our attention.All the best, Liz</blockquote>


<p>One last praise - one of my biggest gripes with using Evernote (besides the notes vs tasks thing) was that the iOS app doesn&#8217;t work offline on my iOS 5 iPhone 4, even when I&#8217;m a paying customer. It crashes - a lot. Maybe they&#8217;ve changed that since I stopped using Evernote, but I won&#8217;t be sticking around to find out. Orchestra rocks.</p>

<p>Some features to work on in the future:</p>
<p>- A way to share a list of tasks, not just a task.</p>
<p>- A way to delete comments in a task.</p>
<p>- The iOS app should operate in landscape please!</p>
