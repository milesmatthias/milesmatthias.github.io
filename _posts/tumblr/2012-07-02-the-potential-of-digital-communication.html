<p>We live in a world where it&#8217;s never been easier to communicate, yet loads of people continue to struggle to form strong bonds with the people they care about.</p>

<p>Smartphones and social networks allow us to communicate instantly with anyone, anywhere, and anytime.</p>

<p>A select percentage of people in the world harness these tools to their potential. They connect strongly with the people they care about. They know what&#8217;s going on in their lives, how they feel, what they can do to help, and why they&#8217;re important to each other.</p>

<p>But what about the parent with an 80 hour a week job and 6 kids? What about the service member stationed abroad that only has ten minutes a day to check e-mails and posts? What about people with challenges like Autism that hinder their ability to really connect?</p>

<p>Those people don&#8217;t have the time to figure out how to best use these tools. As software engineers, it&#8217;s our responsibility to take the state of digital communication forward. Abstract the method to all of the madness of tweets, likes, and posts, and make a service that truly brings people together regardless of their day-to-day challenges.</p>
