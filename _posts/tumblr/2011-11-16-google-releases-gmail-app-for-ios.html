<p>One word: Disappointed. Besides the incredibly sloppy release, the numerous missing features (no multiple account support? Really?) make this not even worth trying. </p>

<p>One positive note: I like seeing more apps use the newer side panel navigation that Facebook first came out with. I haven&#8217;t seen a native iOS app do that yet. I wonder if that will eventually be a built-in control at some point provided by Apple. </p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ll join the crowd in saying, &#8220;Come on Google! We idealize you and this is what you give us?&#8221;</p>
