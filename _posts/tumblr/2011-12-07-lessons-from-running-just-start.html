<p>Just start! I couldn&#8217;t run a mile without needing oxygen a few months ago. To make it worse, I didn&#8217;t help myself get any better. All I would do was look at people that were athletes - people that could run marathons in just a few hours. I got down on myself and thought I would never be like them.</p>
<p>When I did get a gust of inspiration to try to exercise (Biggest Loser episode, Lance Armstrong commercial, Spongebob episode, etc.), I would try to be like those athletes. I would try to run as far and as fast as I could. If I didn&#8217;t do a marathon in under three hours, I&#8217;d consider myself a failure.</p>
<p>Months later, I&#8217;m awesome. I ran 10.5 miles in just over 2 hours last week! Today, I went outside when it was 20 degrees (F) and windy outside, with snow and ice all over the ground, and ran 4 miles in 55 minutes! The ice and snow patches were like those football highknee drills I used to do, and it was fun!</p>
<p><strong>What changed?</strong> I started. I got a heart rate monitor and ran until it told me I needed to take a rest. I&#8217;d walk a little bit, and then when my heart rate was at the bottom of my range, I&#8217;d run again. That is all I can do. For me, that means running for a couple minutes and then walking for a few minutes. I don&#8217;t judge myself on how far I didn&#8217;t go or how long it took me - I do what I can do.</p>
<p>Once I recognized my limits, and just started working within them, the burden of self-pressure and self-guilt was gone. Running and exercise are actually fun for me now! I go outside when it&#8217;s freezing and run because it makes me feel good and I love exploring the outdoors, not because I have some crazy idealistic image in my head of who I should look like (Arnold Schwarzenegger, that Old Spice guy, Squidward, etc.).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always known that it&#8217;s important to live within your means financially, but I&#8217;m starting to see that lesson apply to other areas too. Don&#8217;t worry about other people - they really don&#8217;t matter. Do whatever you can, and just start.</p>

<p>PS - The best workout music I&#8217;ve heard is <a href="http://www.thewhitepanda.com/" target="_blank">The White Panda</a> by far. They do energetic remixes of popular songs and they&#8217;re all free on their website. I put them all on my iPhone and just hit shuffle when I run. I have headphones that have the button/mic so I can skip a song if I&#8217;m not feeling it. </p>
