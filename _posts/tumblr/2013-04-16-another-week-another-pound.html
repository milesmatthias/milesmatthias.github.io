<p>I got pretty big in college. An unlimited, free cafeteria and a dual degree Computer Science and Information Assurance program don&#8217;t result in weight loss. It&#8217;s almost two years later and I haven&#8217;t lost any of it. I have been pretty busy, what with getting married and worrying about making a career, however life will always be busy, so it&#8217;s just something I need to figure out how to fix.</p>

<h2>Getting a framework that works for me</h2>

<p>Two months ago I started the WeightWatchers for men online program and I&#8217;m already down 10 pounds. That&#8217;s 1.25 pounds lost a week, so I&#8217;m on a pretty good path.</p>

<p>Controlling what I eat hasn&#8217;t been the challenge. I actually prefer fruits and vegetables to lots of breaded and fried things, so eating better hasn&#8217;t been difficult. I&#8217;ve tried apps on my iPhone that help me count calories, but I always thought it tedious to track every single little thing, even things that were supposedly good for me, like fruit and vegatables. WeightWatchers doesn&#8217;t count calories, instead counting point values that they assign to foods. All raw fruits and vegetables are 0 points, so anytime I&#8217;m hungry but I&#8217;m low on points for the day, I grab some fruit or a vegetable and don&#8217;t worry about it hurting my daily stats. It&#8217;s been really enjoyable and I haven&#8217;t felt hungry at all.</p>

<h2>Scheduling has been tough</h2>

<p>For me the challenge has been fitting in exercise. I work full time, work on side projects on my own time, and always enjoy spending time relaxing with my wife, so I&#8217;ve frequently gotten to the end of the day only to realize that I haven&#8217;t exercised at all. String a few of those kinds of days together and a lost week goes by. For me, planning has been the key. Every night before I go to bed I write down an exact schedule on my iPhone, detailing everything I need to get done. It usually looks something like this:</p>

<p>7 am wake up</p>

<p>8 - 5 work</p>

<p>5 - 6 work on side projects</p>

<p>6 - 6:45 exercise</p>

<p>6:45 - 7 make dinner</p>

<p>7 - 7:30 dinner</p>

<p>8 - 10 relax together</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing this for a few weeks and it&#8217;s worked out pretty well.</p>

<h2>Getting everything done</h2>

<p>In order to stay productive and get all of the little things I need to get done done, I&#8217;ve also been using the Pomodoro technique quite a bit. Basically, I&#8217;ll set a timer for about 30 minutes or so, work during the timer, and at the end of the timer do something that I either want to do or need to get done. It serves as a reward for working hard for those 30 minutes, forces me to work harder since I know I only have 30 minutes, and reduces the worry that I&#8217;m not making progress on work by doing something I want to or need to get done.</p>

<h2>Work out anywhere, anytime</h2>

<p>Another tool that&#8217;s been useful for me over the last few weeks is an iPhone app called <a href="http://goteemo.com/" target="_blank">Teemo</a>. I&#8217;ve tried a ton of fitness apps for my iPhone and Teemo is by far the best one for me. It provides quick, bodyweight only exercises that can be done at anytime and in the home. An exercise or two from Teemo is usually one of the things I do after a good 30 minute working session.</p>
