<p>I was listening to an iTunesU lecture from the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/building-business-entrepreneurship/id381702699?i=92732359" target="_blank">University of Oxford by Fiona Reid</a>, who talked about the methods to use to write a business plan to present to investors. She also talked a lot about her experience and gave several pitfalls to avoid. It was a great lecture and I came away thinking, maybe I should get some practice writing business plans.</p>
<p>But what if I don&#8217;t really want to actually pitch to investors? What if I just want to write a business plan for practice and have it reviewed by people who could give me advice?</p>
<p>I did some Googling (&#8220;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=business+plan+review" target="_blank">business plan review</a>&#8221;, &#8220;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=business+plan+review+community" target="_blank">business plan review community</a>&#8221;) and it seems like there are either templates or companies looking to charge for a business plan review. I didn&#8217;t find a place yet that allows you to practice writing business plans, have it reviewed by a community, and get feedback for practice.</p>
<p>It seems like a fairly easy project to setup a Gmail account that could act as a go-between for people looking to practice writing a business plan and for people looking to review practice business plans to help young entrepreneurs. Someone with a practice business plan looking to get someone to review it would simply share a Google Doc with the service&#8217;s email address with edit permissions. The service would then be responsible to share it on to a list of people that have signed up to glance over business plans and provide feedback.</p>
<p>It could also be done by adjusting the visibility of a Google Doc to &#8220;Anyone with the link&#8221;, and then the service would be responsible for sharing the link to the Google Doc to reviewers.</p>
