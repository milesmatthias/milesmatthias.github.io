<p>Recently, the FCC handed down a $25,000 fine to Google for <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/04/16/google-street-view-fcc/" target="_blank">"impeding an investigation"</a> by the FCC. The investigation was over Google&#8217;s use of their camera mounted cars which allow them to capture images to use in their Street View product.</p>

<p>Understanding where wifi networks are helps Google (and all applications) understand your location when you need it with more accuracy, so in an effort to kill two birds with one stone, Google had their Street View cars sniff wifi networks.</p>

<p>If you stop reading this article right here, and don&#8217;t make any effort to actually understand any of the technologies behind these actions, you would think that Google is commiting a huge privacy violation.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to enlighten yourself as to the real nature of these actions, please continue reading.</p>

<p>Wifi networks can either be encrypted (requiring you to know the wifi password if you wish to connect to the network) or un-encrypted. If your wifi network is unencrypted, then anyone, without any password or extra keys, can connect to your network and see what&#8217;s going on on your network.</p>

<p>Google&#8217;s Street View cars were only able to listen to unencrypted wifi networks, and because people using those networks entered passwords for services while using those networks, Google could see them.</p>

<p>Think about that for a moment and you&#8217;ll understand why the idea of sniffing open wifi being illegal is entirely ridiculous.</p>

<p>Maybe a non-technical example will help. Imagine you&#8217;re at your house and someone is walking by while they are walking their dog. You, for some crazy reason, decide to yell your e-mail password out your window.</p>

<p>"MY GMAIL PASSWORD ID CHICKEN485!!!!!"</p>

<p>The man innocently walking by your house while walking his dog, hears your password. He chooses not to go out and log onto your gmail because he&#8217;s not a criminal or a jerk.</p>

<p>Later, the entire neighborhood gets wind of this incident and is furious with the man walking his dog because he knows your password.</p>

<p>Hope this helps you understand this situation a little better.</p>
