One word: Disappointed. Besides the incredibly sloppy release, the numerous missing features (no multiple account support? Really?) make this not even worth trying. 

One positive note: I like seeing more apps use the newer side panel navigation that Facebook first came out with. I haven’t seen a native iOS app do that yet. I wonder if that will eventually be a built-in control at some point provided by Apple. 

Anyway, I’ll join the crowd in saying, “Come on Google! We idealize you and this is what you give us?”
