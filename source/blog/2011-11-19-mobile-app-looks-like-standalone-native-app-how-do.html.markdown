The only website I’ve seen do this is m.funnyordie.com and it’s pretty interesting. As we are seeing more and more mobile web apps look like native apps, this is the only one I’ve seen that looks truly like a standalone native app. I’m curious to find out how it works. 
Check out the question I posted at Stack Overflow.
