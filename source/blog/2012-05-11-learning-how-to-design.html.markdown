Learning how to design.I’ve been trying to learn design more and more lately so that I can be a more well-rounded programmer, however it’s been a struggle. I’ve been reading books, including Design For Hackers but haven’t been able to turn things I read into actual projects where I use that design knowledge.

This service is free, and takes an approach that makes me hopeful for learning some design practices. Each week they issue a challenge to teach you and help you grow in a certain design aspect. You submit your work and your work is given review and feedback by the entire community of other design students and a group of design experts.

I’m excited about this. I’ll blog about how it’s going.
