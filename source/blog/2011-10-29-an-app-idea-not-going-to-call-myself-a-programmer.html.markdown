Last night I read "Don’t Call Yourself a Programmer" and was blown away. I graduated a few months ago and have been itching to learn more about the “real world.” How much does this degree I got matter? What do I need to focus on to achieve my goals?
Well the biggest thing I got out of that post was that even though I don’t like it, the game is all about networking. Put yourself out there, meet people any way you can, and help each other. Help each other, pour everything into your relationships, and you’ll have a strong network of friends willing to help you too.
Unfortunately, I’m still learning how to do that. Building strong relationships simply isn’t my strength, so I’m really trying to work on it. Luckily I’m engaged to someone who is great at building strong relationships and I get a chance to watch great relationship builders all the time.
One of the things I’ve noticed is that they share everything with each other. They talk all the time and they know everything about each other. They are in constant communication with each other. Usually they have some way to remind each other every few weeks to give their friends a call and update each other about their lives. Which made me think of an app.
I would love to have an app on my phone that will automatically schedule reminders to call contacts on a rotation. Make sure I keep in touch with everyone the way I should, keep track of when I have extra time on my calendar and make sure I use it effectively.
Maybe it could even integrate with my friend, Chris Eidhof’s new app - Met. I’d use Met when I meet someone, and this app idea to make sure I keep in touch.
Feel free to contact me if it seems like something you’d use too!
