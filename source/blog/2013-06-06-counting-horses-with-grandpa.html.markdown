At the viewing for my grandpa on Tuesday night we had an opportunity to stand up and share a memory of him with the family. I was enjoying listening to everyone else’s stories so I didn’t think of any at the time, but I remembered one that I wish I would have remembered earlier:

One year for Thanksgiving we had our family dinner in the basement of a church in a town about an hour away from my grandparent’s home in Cedar Falls. I don’t remember how old I was. Mom let me ride with grandpa, so I climbed in the passenger seat, just me and grandpa in the car.

We got on the highway and he said, “Hey Miles, want to play a game?” I’m pretty competitive so I said, “Sure, you’re going down Grandpa!”

He continues to explain the game to me, “Okay, we each look out our own windows and count how many horses we see on our side. When we get to the church, whoever has the most horses wins.” This was going to a landslide: a young kid versus a senior citizen focusing on driving. I had this in the bag.

"Two rules though: if there is a cemetery on your side, your count gets reset to 0." Okay, that makes sense. "And, you automatically win if there’s a 2 ton, steel bull on your side." I didn’t know Iowa that well at the time, so naturally I said to him, "Are you sure that’s tobacco in your pipe grandpa? Maybe I should be driving."

I sit straight up and get ready to count. A few minutes later I say, “I’ve got 12! How many do you have Grandpa?” He sadly replies, “2.” I wonder if I should omit a few horses from my count to not make this so one sided, but after all I’m his grandkid so that thought went right out my head. I even see some ostriches and convince grandpa to let me count ostriches too. I was so excited.

4 cemeteries on my side. 4. I was so mad. Every time a cemetery would pass though, there was usually a ranch with a few horses on the other side so I tried to count as many as I could thinking that I was still in the running.

About 45 minutes into the trip, I’m plastered to my window looking for every horse I could find, and grandpa taps me on the shoulder and says, “Hey Miles, look what’s coming up on my side.”

A 2 ton, steel bull.

As mad as I was about the cemeteries, I was livid and astounded about this. I realized that grandpa grew up in Iowa and probably knew these highways like the back of his hand. “You set me up Grandpa! Not fair!”

The entire Thanksgiving dinner all I could think about was riding home with grandpa so I could have the bull on my side and rub it in his face.

I begged my mom to let me ride back to Cedar Falls with him, got in the car with him all excited, and immediately asked, “Hey can we play the horse counting game again?!”

His reply: “Nah, that game is no fun anymore.”

Out of all of the games I played with my grandpa over the year, this one sticks with me and I still hold a bit of a grudge. You were a clever guy and I’ll miss you, Grandpa.
