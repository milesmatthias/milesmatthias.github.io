I’ve never been a good runner. Even though I’ve usually been overweight and out of shape, I’ve always been able to beat anyone in a sprint. Running a mile though? I could barely walk a mile. Whenever I would have to do the mile in gym class I would dread it. You would think I was about to try to climb Everest with how white my face got. With every ounce of me completely against running a mile, I did finish it. But I always did it the wrong way - I always sprinted the mile.

Recently I’ve taken up running again and I haven’t sprinted once. I bought a heart rate monitor, allowed it to tell me what was too much for me to take on, and just kept going. Unassumingly, I will just start walking. Then I’ll run because I want to. My heart rate monitor will tell me to slow down because my heart is on the verge of exploding. So I go back to walking. Then after a while I run again. I used to feel like I was about to die every time I did any sort of distance running, but now I get that elusive “runner’s high” each and every time I run. I know my limits, listen to myself, and most importantly - I run because it’s fun. I’m hoping to do my first marathon in the next year.

Why does this matter? Because it applies to everything else in my life. Everything I’ve struggled with - my weight, my health, my career, and my relationships - have all gained from approaching life with the running, not sprinting, mentality. I wanted to write this post to help anyone out there that might be like me - watching the YC and TechStars teams get 3 hours or less of sleep at night, use t-shirts for towels, and bathe once a month because they’re working on their startup 20 hours a day. Don’t feel hopeless. Don’t feel like you’re not earning it. Don’t feel like you’re not working hard enough. You know what happens - you go strong for about a week and then you crash hard. 

I did. This week for me has been the first week back after crashing for about a month. I was working late nights and weekends on my goals, and I got to a point where I was too sick of a computer to even look at one. I considered changing my profession entirely. But through the help of my wonderful fiancee, I recognized that it was normal for me to feel that way. Just like my running, when I got back to working hard, I was going harder than any other time in my life. And I know I’ll crash again, but it won’t be so soon this time. And I won’t be out of the game for so long. Each crash cycle will get shorter, each running cycle will get longer and faster - and I’ll get where I’m going.

My fiancee has a random quote generator on her Android and she sends me quotes often. She’s been sending me this one repeatedly recently to keep me going. It’s amazing what what forget when we get older:

"Rivers know this: there is no hurry. We shall get there some day." — Winnie the Pooh

I’ve also been inspired recently by “New Day” by Kanye West & Jay-Z - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ula5VyZA4Ns
