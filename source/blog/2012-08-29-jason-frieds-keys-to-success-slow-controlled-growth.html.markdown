Jason Fried''s keys to success: Slow, controlled growth and keeping people happy.This is one of my favorite interviews of Jason Fried. I really believe he has the right attitude towards running a company. The happiness of people is the most important thing in the world, and your business tactics should reflect that. That means doing things for the long term and doing what’s right to make customers and employees happy. The story of 37Signals encourages me to constantly ask, “What’s important here?” when making decisions, instead of assuming what everyone else is doing reflects what’s important.
