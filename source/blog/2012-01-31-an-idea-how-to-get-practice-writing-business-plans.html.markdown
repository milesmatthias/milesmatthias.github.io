I was listening to an iTunesU lecture from the University of Oxford by Fiona Reid, who talked about the methods to use to write a business plan to present to investors. She also talked a lot about her experience and gave several pitfalls to avoid. It was a great lecture and I came away thinking, maybe I should get some practice writing business plans.
But what if I don’t really want to actually pitch to investors? What if I just want to write a business plan for practice and have it reviewed by people who could give me advice?
I did some Googling (“business plan review”, “business plan review community”) and it seems like there are either templates or companies looking to charge for a business plan review. I didn’t find a place yet that allows you to practice writing business plans, have it reviewed by a community, and get feedback for practice.
It seems like a fairly easy project to setup a Gmail account that could act as a go-between for people looking to practice writing a business plan and for people looking to review practice business plans to help young entrepreneurs. Someone with a practice business plan looking to get someone to review it would simply share a Google Doc with the service’s email address with edit permissions. The service would then be responsible to share it on to a list of people that have signed up to glance over business plans and provide feedback.
It could also be done by adjusting the visibility of a Google Doc to “Anyone with the link”, and then the service would be responsible for sharing the link to the Google Doc to reviewers.
