There are a lot of things to get excited about in today’s ever connected and quickly advancing world. Technology is cooler than ever, providing tons of life altering capabilities that no one thought imaginable. But to me, there are two things that I’m most excited about: building technology to improve in-person social interactions and bringing technology to developing countries.

The things that interest me are a direct reflection of my life experience and what I care about. One of the most important things to me is family and close friends. Building close relationships that truly improve your experience is crucial and challenging. Technology, especially with the advent of the smartphone, has been (rightly) accused of detracting from true interpersonal connections. It is true that you can now find people with similar interests all over the world from the comfort of your couch, but the ability to really connect with the people sitting across from you at the table has been minimized by the never-ending and advertisement-backed system of apps and DVRs.

However, technology does allow us to be more efficient in sharing who we are with the people we care about. After going on a trip, it’s easier to share pictures and moments with all of your friends and family. When needing a hand moving to a new place, it’s simple to message your entire family or group of friends. However these same applications not only distract us from having meaningful in-person interactions, but continually condition us to behave in a way that makes advertisers on smartphones and TVs more money. My biggest pet peeve is seeing a group of people out at a restaurant or a concert together, and each of them is on their smartphone ignoring the people around them. I think that technology can have a place in helping to re-enforce the positive relationship building practices that so many of us have forgotten about, it’s simply up to someone to build something to make it happen.

The other thing that interests me a great deal is revolutionizing the way people in developing countries live and work by introducing technology that they’ve never heard of or seen before. Building software and hardware that fits their unique needs and goals, can tear down long standing physical barriers. The power of the internet can help local farmers reach customers overseas that are willing to pay much more than anyone locally. It can help children dying of easily cured diseases get funding for their simple, life-saving procedures (see watsi.org). Technology can even prepare the next generation of leaders with the latest and greatest strategies from around the world in helping their country grow.

So those are the things that get me excited about technology. If those are the things that interest you as well, then we should talk.
