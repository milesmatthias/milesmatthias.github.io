I’m frustrated with Apple. You’re supposed to be the leader. You’re supposed to be the ones who lead the charge in the fight to finding the most elegant and advantageous integration of technology into our daily lives. You gave us a simple personal computer. You gave us the touch screen. Lately you’ve just been giving us a re-hashed version of what everyone else has been giving us.

Sure, there were always products in the same genre as you when you launched an innovation. There were computers before you gave us the Apple II. There were smartphones before you gave us the iPhone. And there were even tablets before you gave us the iPad. But where the competition focused on incorrect priorities, you turned down a different road, simplified things we didn’t care so much about and opened new doors to ideas we hadn’t even imagined yet.

If I weren’t a developer and only used Apple products and services, your announcement today of iOS 7 would blow my mind. I wouldn’t have already heard about photo filters from Instagram, or calendar reminders based on real-time traffic from Google, or sharing photos and videos with comments from Facebook, or the idea of flat design from virtually every 3rd party app out there today. Maybe that’s more my problem than yours, but to me, you seem to have gone from an intelligent shark devouring the competition because they’re too slow and stupid, to a slow, brainless whale slowly swimming with your mouth open to catch whatever scraps of fish the real leaders have graciously left you.

People have put some awesome work into creating amazing experiences and features on your platform. Support them, integrate better with them, and stop turning them into competition. Instead of recognizing that Google is the absolute best at maps, email, and cloud services, you create your own service offerings in order to force people who have long enjoyed Google’s superior experience on iOS into a decision between the hand that gave them the iPhone in the first place and the genius software engineers at Google. For non-technical people, I can see how a single AppleID sign on that gives them all of the technical capabilities they need would be attractive.

But the technological landscape is growing more fragmented every day. There are now more technological-aware categories than super user and “What’s a computer?” Yes, the majority of the world still doesn’t have smartphones, or even cell phones for that matter. But there is also a massive population online today that is aware of the advantages of the internet and know how to sign up for and use online services. This is no longer just about 20-somethings knowing all of the tips and tricks about using an iPhone and having to explain what an iPhone is to their parents. Nowadays our parents are catching on to technology sometimes faster than the younger generation! It’s not a big deal for my grandma to sign up for Gmail or Pinterest, she’s been hit over the head a million times on how signing up for a service works. A single sign on for the technological illiterate is becoming less and less relevant every day.

I would love to see Apple stay awesome at hardware, design, and human interaction. But leave the software to the guys who do it best. Integrate with them. Stop wasting a year working on duplicating the functionality that your supposed best friends (third party developers) have worked so hard to bring to your beautiful platform.

I want an Apple that doesn’t offer a calendar, a web browser, photo sharing, or even email. I want an Apple that focuses on making the best device that integrates with the best online software possible.

But that doesn’t make sense when you’re the largest technology company in the world, have thousands of employees, and have investors to answer to. More products, more money, more enemies, and more problems for your users.

I guess I need to stop getting my hopes up when watching a WWDC keynote.
