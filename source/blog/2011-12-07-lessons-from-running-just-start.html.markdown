Just start! I couldn’t run a mile without needing oxygen a few months ago. To make it worse, I didn’t help myself get any better. All I would do was look at people that were athletes - people that could run marathons in just a few hours. I got down on myself and thought I would never be like them.
When I did get a gust of inspiration to try to exercise (Biggest Loser episode, Lance Armstrong commercial, Spongebob episode, etc.), I would try to be like those athletes. I would try to run as far and as fast as I could. If I didn’t do a marathon in under three hours, I’d consider myself a failure.
Months later, I’m awesome. I ran 10.5 miles in just over 2 hours last week! Today, I went outside when it was 20 degrees (F) and windy outside, with snow and ice all over the ground, and ran 4 miles in 55 minutes! The ice and snow patches were like those football highknee drills I used to do, and it was fun!
What changed? I started. I got a heart rate monitor and ran until it told me I needed to take a rest. I’d walk a little bit, and then when my heart rate was at the bottom of my range, I’d run again. That is all I can do. For me, that means running for a couple minutes and then walking for a few minutes. I don’t judge myself on how far I didn’t go or how long it took me - I do what I can do.
Once I recognized my limits, and just started working within them, the burden of self-pressure and self-guilt was gone. Running and exercise are actually fun for me now! I go outside when it’s freezing and run because it makes me feel good and I love exploring the outdoors, not because I have some crazy idealistic image in my head of who I should look like (Arnold Schwarzenegger, that Old Spice guy, Squidward, etc.).
I’ve always known that it’s important to live within your means financially, but I’m starting to see that lesson apply to other areas too. Don’t worry about other people - they really don’t matter. Do whatever you can, and just start.
Run with me and join my street team on RunKeeper!
PS - The best workout music I’ve heard is The White Panda by far. They do energetic remixes of popular songs and they’re all free on their website. I put them all on my iPhone and just hit shuffle when I run. I have headphones that have the button/mic so I can skip a song if I’m not feeling it.
