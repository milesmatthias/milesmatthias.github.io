This is a confusing time to be a young developer.

HTML5 vs Native. It’s everywhere. It’s an all out war. People are picking sides and fighting passionately about why they’re right. The battle may never end, and if it does, it probably won’t be in my lifetime. I’m a young developer and I want to get great at making great products. But I would hate to get to be an amazing web developer only to find out years later that native apps are really the way to go. And vice-versa.

I’m lucky I work at InspiringApps, a Boulder team that loves making all apps, web and native. I’m working on a cool HTML5 app that uses WebSQL to provide an offline experience (I’m learning a ton, it’s awesome!), but next month I might be coding an iPad app in Objective-C. Who knows? I love that. I get to soak up knowledge and experience from all sorts of technologies in the making of great products.

Maybe in the grand scheme of things, it’s not important which language or architecture you’re implementing something in. Maybe if you want to get great at something, you should get great at design. Design something really, really well, and then figure out the syntax to make it happen later.

But when I say design, I don’t just mean UI/UX design. Designing the implementation of a product is crucial as well because a good road map will cut down on the time and issues involved in actually building the product. But to design a good road map you need to know all of the little bumps in the road that you only learn by traveling it a thousand times!

Maybe there aren’t that many bumps in the roads. Maybe doing something once or twice is enough to design a product architecture wisely. Then you would still be an effective product designer without needing to know every little intricacy of a language/platform. Maybe there will always be little weird problems you have to hack out, regardless of how long you’ve spent becoming an expert at a certain language or platform.

It’s exhausting figuring this all out.

If you’re an experienced (a.k.a elderly) developer, what’s been your experience? What one thing are you great at? Leave a comment below!
