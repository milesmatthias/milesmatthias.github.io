I’ve been using Orchestra for the past few weeks and thought I’d take a second to write about my experience and share my suggestions. Hopefully it helps the great crew at Orchestra make it better.
Orchestra is a pretty simple to-do app, with one exception. You make lists, then tasks on those lists, but their claim to fame - you share those tasks with people, regardless of whether or not they’re a user of Orchestra. 
If you share a task with someone that isn’t a user of Orchestra, they get a text or email letting them know and giving them a chance to say something about the task. Something about the task? What?
This is my favorite part of Orchestra. Each task is like a conversation thread. You can invite people to join you in discussing the task or just talk away yourself. 
I’ve been using each task as an endless bin of thoughts where I can keep everything semi-organized. I used to use notes, but really I need notes with a bin for my thoughts. Everything revolves around getting something done - which is why I love the tasks - but nothing is definite of quick - so I need a place to keep all of my thoughts as they progress when trying to accomplish the task. 
For instance - I know that with my work as a developer and my pursuit to own my own business, I experience a lot of random things that would benefit myself to keep track of and others to learn from. But I’m horrible at remembering stuff.
That’s why I have a list called ‘blog ideas’ where I make a task anytime I think of something I should write about and share. Then if I have more random thoughts or specific details that I want to remember, I just throw it under the task as a comment. Everything is organized, I don’t have to worry about keeping it organized, and Orchestra lets me throw all my random thoughts at it. I’m canceling my Evernote subscription.
The other thing that has proved invaluable to me in using this app is its corresponding web app. I can throw all my random thoughts on my phone where ever I am and when it comes time to sit down and write a blog post, all of my thoughts are on the web app. (Also, if you’re pretty nerdy and want a great example of an HTML5 web app that works just as well offline as online - you should see orchestra.com.) In fact, this blog post itself is compromised of my random scribbles that I’ve thrown into the Orchestra app on my phone about doing a review of Orchestra!
The iOS app itself is also a great demonstration of how cool customizing iOS components can be. I questioned whether or not it was written in native Obj-C or HTML5, but when I tweeted it I was very nicely responded by one of Orchestra’s iOS engineers:


This wasn’t too surprising considering that when I couldn’t figure out why I couldn’t share an entire list with my fiancee, Orchestra’s customer support team was more than willing to lend me an explanation:

Hi Miles, My sincerest apologies for the delay in getting back to you! We’ve been looking into this and believe we found the root of the problem - let me explain:Basically we only send text messages when tasks are shared with a phone number, not shared lists - only because there’s not a great way to make the latter actionable on the phone for a non-user. This is not a great experience, so we’ll be changing it soon so shared list invites do go over text message. So stay tuned for that. In the meantime if you send a share a task with her phone number, that will initiate a text message. Better yet, if she gets an Orchestra account and adds her phone number to Settings < Profile, those tasks and list invitations will arrive in her app. Apologies for this confusion and shortcoming on our part, thanks for bringing it to our attention.All the best, Liz


One last praise - one of my biggest gripes with using Evernote (besides the notes vs tasks thing) was that the iOS app doesn’t work offline on my iOS 5 iPhone 4, even when I’m a paying customer. It crashes - a lot. Maybe they’ve changed that since I stopped using Evernote, but I won’t be sticking around to find out. Orchestra rocks.

Some features to work on in the future:
- A way to share a list of tasks, not just a task.
- A way to delete comments in a task.
- The iOS app should operate in landscape please!
