I saw my friend Chris Eidhof do an app in four weeks, and I thought it would be a great thing for me to do since I’m learning Sencha Touch these next few weeks. I’ve never done much with Sencha Touch and I’ll be using it in my next job.

I think that my previous app idea of a place to track contacts to keep in touch with on a rotation is simple enough to do in three weeks.

Basically, one screen with a list of the contacts you’ve entered to be on rotation. When you mark one as contacted/checked-up with, it moves that person to the bottom of the list. I think it makes most sense to let all of the names in the list be ‘checkable’, because who knows when you bump into people.

There would be another screen for adding a name to the list. I think that’s where I could get fancy. I would start by simply adding names. Then I might add support for adding a phone number, with the added feature of calling the person when you tap their name. Eventually, I could add the ability to add a name from your address book, or create a new contact in the address book from the name and number you put in.

I’ll start with the very basic functionality and add features as I learn more about Sencha Touch and I have time.

This week I’m going to do some introductory learning about Sencha Touch, some basic prototypes, and some searches on the app store to see if there is anything similar out there.

Feel free to leave me feedback!
