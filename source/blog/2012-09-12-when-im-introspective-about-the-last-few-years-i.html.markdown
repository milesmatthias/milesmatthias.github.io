title: When I’m introspective about the last few years I think the biggest mistake
  that we made, as a company, is betting too much on HTML5 as opposed to native… because
  it just wasn’t there. And it’s not that HTML5 is bad. I’m actually, on long-term,
  really excited about it. One of the things that’s interesting is we actually have
  more people on a daily basis using mobile Web Facebook than we have using our iOS
  or Android apps combined. So mobile Web is a big thing for us.
