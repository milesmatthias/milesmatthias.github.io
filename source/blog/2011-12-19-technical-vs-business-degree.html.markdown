I overheard some people discussing best path for someone to open their own business. They felt that it was more important to get a business degree, and then learn technical skills later. I wasn’t surprised - these were business people talking.
Personally, I’m more of a technical person, so I say that getting a technical degree initially is far more important than a business degree. Business principles are simple compared to the intricacies of building something. It’s also much more central to the end goal of owning a business to be able to actually create value by being able to build a product. You can learn all of the marketing and financial tactics you want, but if you can’t provide a product or service to your customers, none of it matters.
Tech people rule. Am I just biased? Do you agree?
