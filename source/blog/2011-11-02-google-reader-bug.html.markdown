Google Reader released an updated UI today and I thought I would try it out again. I haven’t used Reader in a few years, but as I follow more people’s blogs online, I could use it (And I like the Reeder apps for iPhone).
But alas, similar to their release of the Gmail iPhone app today, it’s buggy. My main beef bug that I found? Google Reader doesn’t actually delete folders. 
Try it - make a folder, delete it, and then try to make a new folder with the exact same name. Google Reader will say that the changes have been saved, but nothing actually changes.
More evidence: open Reeder, or any other Google Reader client, and see that the folders you “deleted” still show up.
What’s the deal Google? Anyone else had any issues with it?
