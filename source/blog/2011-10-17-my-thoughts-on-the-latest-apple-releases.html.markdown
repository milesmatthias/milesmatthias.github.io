Apple releases are a lot of fun. You get all excited, pacing in anticipation, constantly arguing about what they might or might not release, and then it happens. The time comes when all of the talk has to either walk or fall. This round of releases were kind of a crawl for me.

iOS 5:
First, I should say that I’m an iOS developer, so I have had iOS 5 on my iPhone 4 ever since it came out several months ago for the developers. I use the notification center every day and the added touches to core apps like calendar, messaging, and the camera, are things I delight in all the time. 
Newstand: The store in Newstand is disabled for me. Don’t know why, always has been, and honestly, it’s probably a good thing. I read enough books and articles online, I don’t need to add magazines and a daily newspaper.
Reminders: I don’t use it. The geo-location based to-dos are a genius idea, but my to-do needs revolve mainly around having the ability to add notes to a task, organize tasks by different lists, and then have the lists and tasks sync where I can use them on any device I’m at. I use Orchestra instead.
Cards: Beautiful app, has a few bugs, but overall really nice. I sent a card, but it hasn’t arrived yet, I’ll be tweeting how that goes when it happens, so follow me for that. My one gripe was that with all of the focus on simplicity and intuitiveness, I was utterly shocked when the cards app asked for a CVV without offering any explanation or context. I knew what that was, so I looked at the back of my credit card to find the three digit number, but I wonder how many people would really know that.
Safari: I love the new Reader - I just wish I knew as a developer how I could write code to help it make my pages look nice too. I also love the idea of Reading List and I love how it syncs with Safari. Useful and intuitive - thank you Apple.
iPad: The new keyboard split is honestly the only good upgrade to the iPad on iOS 5. That’s it. For people that sync a lot, the wireless sync is nice too, but I can live without it. What was a terrible experience, however, was how many times I had to enter the Apple ID/password combination when upgrading the device. Every two minutes I was putting in this username/password. Why can’t Apple ask for it once and supply it to all of the other parts that need it on the iPad? It seems like a glaringly obvious decision and something that people might point to as a loss of focus in Steve’s absence.

Lion Upgrade: Why are there two different places I need to go to update software now? I have to go to “Software Update…” and the Updates in the Mac App Store to get everything current. Again, losing focus Apple. Also, I needed another restart after the upgrade happened in order to bring my Mini out of a crawl. Being able to use the newest features was nice and overall the install experience is still the best out there, but just disappointing from Apple.
iPhoto Photo Stream: I love this idea! I won’t need to worry about plugging my iPhone in after going on a trip to make sure all of the photos get put on my mini. I have lost pictures in the past because I didn’t sync up before installing the latest developer beta, and with this new feature I won’t need to worry anymore. It works really well and it’s nice. My one gripe - I can’t delete pictures from the photo stream! Even when I delete the picture on my iPhone, it remains in iPhoto, without an option to delete. I don’t understand this at all - it seems like a privacy violation, giving the impression to any users that are skeptical of the cloud that they really aren’t in control of their data anymore. Come on Apple.

Overall: You’re still the best Apple. I just have such high expectations that I’m not as willing to look past the small mistakes anymore. This next year, dealing with the loss of Steve, will be incredibly hard and incredibly indicative of the future of Apple. Don’t lose focus - a product is for a person - make it simple and intuitive again.
