So I was reading the idea page on Y Combinator’s site earlier today and one thought in particular stuck out to me:

Dating. Current dating sites are not the last word. Better ones will appear. But anyone who wants to start a dating startup has to answer two questions: in addition to the usual question about how you’re going to approach dating differently, you have to answer the even more important question of how to overcome the huge chicken and egg problem every dating site faces. A site like Reddit is interesting when there are only 20 users. But no one wants to use a dating site with only 20 users—which of course becomes a self-perpetuating problem. So if you want to do a dating startup, don’t focus on the novel take on dating that you’re going to offer. That’s the easy half. Focus on novel ways to get around the chicken and egg problem.

I’m willing to bet there are a lot of startups that need to face the chicken and egg problem as task one. I know that every startup benefits from initial users that they get feedback from in order to iterate.
I’m also willing to bet that there are plenty of early-adoption users out there willing to try anything at all. It might be because they want to be in on the ground floor of things, or maybe they just want to provide that valuable initial feedback for startups.
So my question/idea - are there online groups that users can join in order to be informed of the latest alpha-version offerings? Startups would submit their name and a url to the community, the community would organize it in a weekly e-mail. There would also be a website (desktop and mobile) that listed all of the startups within catagories, so that testers could easily find a startup for a particular need.
I haven’t seen any such community online, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. I think the majority of initial users that startups get are a handfull of friends and family. With a community full of willing testers, startups trying to solve the “chicken and the egg” problem could focus more on solving their own unique technical challenges instead of the age-old “chicken and the egg” problem.
I think it would be fun and simple to build too.
Version 1: One web page - left side for signing up as a tester and right side for submitting your startup in need of willing early users. Testers get a summary email each week of startups that have signed up in the previous week.
Version 2: Create desktop and mobile site that organizes all of the submitted startups in categories for easy and quick lookup by testers.
Version 3: Build community infrastructure - allow testers to create a username with this community’s website, track what startups they test, and create a leaderboard of most active testers.
Version 4: Analyze the community - Be able to suggest “power testers” to startups when they submit their url. Possibly charge for this in order to cover operating costs. “Power testers” are members that have tested a certain number of startups in that startups’ category and are at a certain activity level.
Further things to think about with this project:
What would the categories be? (By function or technical details or both?)
How could you cover operating costs sooner instead of Version 4?
