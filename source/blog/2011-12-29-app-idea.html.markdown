I want to be able to give feedback anywhere, anytime. And I don’t want any website to have to sign up with a company.

One company should allow you to make marks anywhere, anytime, submit your feedback to that company, and then that company should do whatever method of feedback the site you’re trying to give feedback to takes.

For instance - imagine the user using the same software to edit Wikipedia, give feedback on design changes for Google, and submit help to github?

That would be cool.
