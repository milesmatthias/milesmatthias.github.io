The internet is awesome, but there can be a lot of people trying to make a quick buck online. When I’m trying to find authoritative research on a topic, it can be difficult. Especially if I want a book to download to my Kindle for reading.

Something I’ve been doing lately is realizing that my university studies provided great research through the textbooks in my classes. So when I want to learn about a particular topic from a person or team that has the main goal of doing honest research, I browse through my old university bookstore’s course listings and see what textbooks are being required for courses.

It would be nice if there were a service to do that automatically. The service could also pull from institutions around the world, interacting with and navigating the university’s course and textbook listings, instead of me just relying on the university systems that I’m accustomed to. I doubt that would happen though, because as ironic as it is, universities themselves would most likely kick back because they might see which textbooks they use as information only paying students should know.

I’ve also looked at a few other university’s textbook websites and noticed that UVA seems to use the same course textbook interface system. Anyone know what that is? Who makes that product?
