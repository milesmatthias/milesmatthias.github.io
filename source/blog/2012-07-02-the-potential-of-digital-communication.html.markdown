We live in a world where it’s never been easier to communicate, yet loads of people continue to struggle to form strong bonds with the people they care about.

Smartphones and social networks allow us to communicate instantly with anyone, anywhere, and anytime.

A select percentage of people in the world harness these tools to their potential. They connect strongly with the people they care about. They know what’s going on in their lives, how they feel, what they can do to help, and why they’re important to each other.

But what about the parent with an 80 hour a week job and 6 kids? What about the service member stationed abroad that only has ten minutes a day to check e-mails and posts? What about people with challenges like Autism that hinder their ability to really connect?

Those people don’t have the time to figure out how to best use these tools. As software engineers, it’s our responsibility to take the state of digital communication forward. Abstract the method to all of the madness of tweets, likes, and posts, and make a service that truly brings people together regardless of their day-to-day challenges.
