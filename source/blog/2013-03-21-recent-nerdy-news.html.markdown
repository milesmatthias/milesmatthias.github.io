Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO, lifts the Apollo F-1 engines off of the ocean floor When man first travelled to the moon, NASA’s engineers had no way of retrieving the engines that shot its astronauts out of the earth’s atmosphere and then fell back to Earth and landed in the ocean. So for almost 60 years, a key component of the mission to the moon that inspired a generation has been sitting on the ocean’s floor. Jeff Bezos, the Founder and CEO of Amazon, was one of those kids motivated by the Apollo missions, and made it his mission to get those engines back. This week, he did it!
